## Sign up form 

Small personal project to learn custom validation API

GitHub pages: https://contrigra.github.io/sign-up-custom-validation/

The point of this project was to learn how to write custom validations in plain JS

### Things I practiced and learnt:

- custom validation api
- how to use :invalid CSS
- formdata workflow
- pattern how to add several event listeners to an element
- reporting custom errors
- different types of events, like `blur`, `focusout`
- how to stop submitting form data on button press
  - if we don't do prevent default on form submit, then it bypasses many other events, as it fires first
  - how to fire a new `formdata` event
- selectors by attribute
- I can access input field data directly from the input element, not through a form
- created many new Anki cards
- Used vimkeys
